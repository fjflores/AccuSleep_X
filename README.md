# AccuSleep

## Updates
**06/12/2021** - Initial release of AccuSleep X. 

## Description

[AccuSleep](https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep) was designed to detect wakefulness, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep in rodents. 
However, its neural network is perfectly capable of detecting more than three states as long as their EEG/EMG patterns are sufficiently distinct.
AccuSleep X allows a user to classify up to eight predefined states (limited only by the number of digits on the keyboard). 
Please run `doc AccuSleep_instructions_X` for details. Otherwise, the installation process is the same as for [AccuSleep](https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep#installation-instructions).
